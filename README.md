Simple shopping list

A simple shopping list, based on an exercise for a udemy.com lesson, teaching JS and how to manipulate the DOM. I kept the initial items provided by the exercise, just for reference. User can add a new item by typing it in the input box and clicking on "enter" (or pressing the Enter key), click on an item to mark it as "done" (click again to toggle) or delete it by clicking on "delete". I also added a button to clear the whole list, which was not part of the exercise. I'll probably keep improving it as it can be actually practical. Haven't bothered with how it looks, only with its functionality. Maybe I will some day.
